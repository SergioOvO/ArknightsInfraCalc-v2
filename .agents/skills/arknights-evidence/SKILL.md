# Arknights Evidence

Use repository evidence tools for every build, test, CLI, benchmark, format, or structure check supporting a conclusion. A bare run must be rerun through the wrapper before delivery.

## Record Runs

1. Create task metadata from `scripts/codex/task_metadata.example.json`: one invariant, root layer, required/consumer/proof/deferred paths, docs impact, side findings, and reviewer fields.
2. Run `scripts/codex/run_evidence.sh --task <slug> --category <category> --stem <name> --inputs '<inputs>' -- <command...>`.
3. Register generated profile, MAA, comparison, or report files with repeated `--artifact kind=path`.
4. Keep every rerun. Do not overwrite failures or use shared output names.

Use categories `build`, `targeted-test`, `full-suite`, `cli`, `performance`, `format`, and `structure`. Include actual layout, operbox, assignment, fixture, policy, output, baseline, seed, and time limit when relevant.

## Match Evidence to Risk

- Owner-local data/logic fix: minimal reproducer, adjacent counterexample, and affected real entry.
- Hard constraint or eligibility: activation/rejection boundaries and final feasibility.
- Objective/tie-break: component and equivalent-optimum checks.
- Candidate generation, pruning, decomposition, Bake/cache, or performance: read the solver-assurance sections of `docs/QUALITY_AND_AUDIT.md`; record guarantee class, differential/oracle or fallback evidence, candidate/benchmark facts, and result status.
- Schedule/export: Team/Shift invariants plus real `plan`/MAA fidelity.

Do not impose every global category on a low-risk documentation or owner-local fix. Do not let a high-risk search-space change pass on one golden snapshot.

## Compare and Finish

For full suite, use `scripts/codex/compare_test_failures.py` on complete Cargo logs and compare exact failure-name sets.

Before completion run:

1. `scripts/codex/check_docs_impact.py --manifest <manifest>`;
2. `scripts/codex/check_task_scope.py --manifest <manifest>`;
3. `scripts/codex/render_evidence.py --manifest <manifest> --output <report>`.

Inspect logs, status files, exit codes, artifacts, changed paths, deferred findings, and renderer “未跑” categories. An extractor may organize complex logs or failure sets, but the main Agent must judge domain semantics, exact/heuristic claims, and final completion.
